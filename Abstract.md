## Abstract

Psychiatric treatment is given to people who experience or express some sort of mental suffering. This suffering can be understood in a variety of ways, for example as a medical, psychological or social problem, although medical or psychological *individual* understandings predominate the psychiatric field. The purpose of this project is to gain greater knowledge of how psychiatric health care professionals navigate between different understandings of mental illness, and how they play themselves out in their understandings in relation to the patients' membership in different sex categories and other social categories. Although the uneven distribution of mental illness across different social categories are frequently studied, it is unknown to what extent psychiatric health care professionals can use of socio-cultural understandings of mental illness. This study is based on interviews with psychiatric health care professionals. Theoretical framework is a socio-cultural understanding of mental health. Analytical framework is discourse psychology and intersectionality theory, with some variant of discourse analysis as the main analytical tool. The results of the study is expected to contribute to an enhanced dialogue between individually and socio-culturally based perspectives on mental health and be of value to policy makers, psychiatric health care professionals and people who promotes social equality in psychiatric care â€“ *in practice as well as in theory*.
