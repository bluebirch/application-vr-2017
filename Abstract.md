## Abstract

Psychiatric treatment is sought by and offered to people who are experiencing or expressing some sort of mental suffering. This suffering can potentially be understood and treated in a variety of different ways, for example as a medical, psychological or social problem.

The overarching theoretical framework will be based on socio-cultural concepts of mental health, theories about social categorization – especially in relation to understandings of normality and deviation, and intersectionality theory. Discourse analysis will be employed to analyze the data. A reference group consisting of senior researchers, with expert knowledge of the field, will be tied to the project. The results will be published in Swedish and international journals. The findings are expected to be of value to psychiatric health care professionals who wish
