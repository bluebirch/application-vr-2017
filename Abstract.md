## Abstract

Psychiatric treatment is given to people who experience or express some sort of mental suffering. This suffering can be understood in a variety of different ways, for example as a medical, psychological or social problem. The purpose of this research project is to gain greater knowledge of how psychiatric health care professionals navigate between different understandings of mental illness, and how they play themselves out in their understandings in relation to the patients' membership in different sex categories and other social categories. In psychiatric health care, medical and psychological views of mental illness, as expressed in psychiatric diagnostic manuals, are predominant. Although variations in mental illness, in relation to social categories are frequently studied, it is unknown how psychiatric health care professionals make use of socio-cultural understandings of mental illness. Psychiatric health care professionals who work with diagnosing and treating patients will be interviewed. The theoretical framework is based on socio-cultural and intersectional views of mental health. Discourse analysis will be used for the analysis. A reference group of researchers with expert knowledge of the field, is tied to the project. The findings will be of value to psychiatric health care professionals who wish to transcend the predominant medical understanding of mental illness and work with other aspects of their patients' lives, including taking gender and other social categories into account. It will also be of relevance to people who work to promote social equality psychiatry - *in practice, as well as in theory*. Finally, the study will contribute to an enhanced dialogue between individually (medical and psychological) and socio-culturally based perspectives on mental health.
